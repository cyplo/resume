%	 ABOUT ME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\aboutme{
I'm \href{mailto:hello@cyplo.net}{Cyryl} and
I like tending to software projects and teams that run them.
I am the most fluent with building large systems but have also worked in
the space of constrained resources.
Technology choice is less important to me than culture.
The more transparent the better! \\
Also puns, I like puns.}

\section{Other information}

\subsection{Review}

Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.

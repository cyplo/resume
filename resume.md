##Experience
I'm take a problem and dig into it. I help solve the business issues, most commonly using software. At most of of my jobs my day consisted of writing programs, documentation, reviewing code, recruiting and teaching. 

**Consultant** at Infusion, *June 2012 - Now*  
Here I'm a main driving force behind Infusion's revamped on-boarding programme, making sure that the new hires feel welcome and that they end the first 3 months with a knowledge of company's culture and best programming practices. I also do write code here. Mostly Java and .Net, sprinkled with some c, c++, python, bash and powershell.

Projects:  

* Pulse - a product for mass remote software installation and monitoring. Used, among others, in demo kiosk installations, phone retail shops and in-flight entertainment systems.
* I've helped build a distributed solution for insurance costs calculation for Metlife Japan. Mostly Java, some IBM mainframes and occasional C++.
* I've worked for other financial institutions on distributed software for risk exposure analysis. Mostly .net, some c++, large in-house computation farms involved.

I was asked to return to Power Media by the head of the whole department, this was quite cool ! I've helped recruit more people and was one of the developers working on the system for TV materials storage.

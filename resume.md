##Day jobs
I take a problem and dig into it. I help solve the business issues, most commonly using software. At most of my jobs my day consisted of writing programs, documentation, reviewing code, recruiting and teaching. I like code with tests, I like continuous deployment and immutable infrastructure. I like Vim.

**Consultant** at Infusion, *June 2012 - Now*  
I'm a main driving force behind Infusion's revamped on-boarding programme, making sure that the new hires feel welcome and that they end the first 3 months with a knowledge of company's culture and best programming practices. Writing code is still where I spend most of my time though, and happily so. Mostly **Java** and **.Net**, sprinkled with some **C**, **C++**, **Python**, bash and powershell.

Projects:  

* Pulse - a product for mass remote software installation and monitoring. Used, among others, in demo kiosk installations, phone retail shops and in-flight entertainment systems.
* I've helped build a distributed solution for insurance cost calculation for Metlife Japan. Mostly Java, some IBM mainframes and occasional C++.
* I've worked for other financial institutions on distributed software for risk exposure analysis. Mostly .Net, some C++, large in-house computation farms involved.


**Senior Software Engineer**, Power Media S.A., *February 2011 - June 2012*

I was asked to return to Power Media by the head of the whole department, this was quite cool ! I've helped recruit more people and was one of the developers working on the system for TV materials storage. The system was written in **C#**, but I've also took a look inside an **Erlang** one and a one in **Obj-c** as well, from time to time. I've convinced the company to [open source](https://github.com/powermedia/PowerMedia.Common) the core libraries used.


**Mobile Games Developer**, iNTRES/Scoreloop, *December 2009 - February 2011*  

I was a part of a team that was tasked with developing a cross-platform, pure C library that provided matchmaking, ladders and other networking capabilities to mobile games, **Pro Evolution Soccer 2011** among others. We've used C89 as the base language. There was another team, working in Ruby on the server side, we had lots of chats with them on the APIs. Oftentimes I needed to delve deeply into performance issues on completely foreign legacy code bases.

**Lead Developer**, Power Media S.A., *June 2007 - December 2009*

This was my first experience as a leader. Despite this we've managed to build the new [travelplanet.pl](http://www.travelplanet.pl/) - a website for the biggest trip broker in Poland. This was a .Net job and involved some quite heavy server machinery. Around **60 different data sources** were involved. In the meantime I've also helped with growing the **Erlang** team and got my hands dirty with proof-of-concept **low-level** Mac **PowerPC** programming. 


**Software Developer**, Power Media S.A., *June 2006 - June 2007*

My first "real" job ! Maintenance on the in-house systems written in Java. Slowly I got into client-facing project as well. Java, Webobjects.

##Some talks I gave
Most of them on the user group meetings across the country. No conferences yet. The links provided are for the slide decks. I prefer dense talks with sparse slides though.  

["Tor for beginners"](https://github.com/cyplo/talks/tree/master/tor_for_beginners) - A talk I gave to the local students' groups on the safety on the Internet and what is Tor, why to use it and why not.

["Erlang for the .Net people"](https://github.com/erlang-wroclaw/erlang_tech_night) - introduction to Erlang with some live coding by me and my friend Fabian

["Anatomy of a debugger"](https://prezi.com/hzvnsznfkgwj/anatomy-of-the-debugger/)  - very high-level overview of how debugging works

##Random hobbies
I like electronics, I design PCBs using KiCad. Rock climbing. Cycling. I've built a sun-powered storage server that acts as a Tor relay as well.
